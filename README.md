## Hi, I'm Menglin / Leonard ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a Python developer
- I like building stuff with Python for backend and JavaScript for frontend
- I'm looking for a job as a Python developer

## About me
- In school: (No I haven't start coding in school) I like playing (chinese)chess and other board games, which helped to train my logic thinking
- In bachelor & master: I learned c/c++/Matlab in the class
- In doctor:
  - I learned JavaScript on Khan Academy and really enjoyed. I also created a simplified [model](https://fr.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-curling-crawling-circling-creatures/4755055945777152) of self-propelled droplets (my doctor topic). 
  - I used openCV in Python to keep track of moving droplets in hundres of images automatically, conducted data analysis with Numpy and visualized results with Matplotlib.
- As a teacher:
  - I programmed several learning apps with Python for my students to practice
  - I programmed my favorite board game five-in-a-row with an AI opponent with the algorithm MiniMax
- As an IT consultant
  - I felt comfortable working with data with Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib doing a anti-money-laundering project, including data cleaning, segmentation of customer data with k-means, visualization, creation of new anti-money-laundering indicators with random-forest algorithm
  - I created a full-stack tender-tracking app with Python/Flask and JavaScript. With just one click, app will scrap informations from major tender platforms with Selenium, download documents, extract information and create a summary with Large Language Models
