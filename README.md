## Hi, I'm Menglin / Leonard ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a python developer
- I like building stuff with python for backend and javascript for frontend
- I'm looking for a job as a python developer

## About me
- In school: (No I haven't start coding in school) I like playing (chinese)chess and other board games, which helped to train my logic thinking
- In bachelor & master: I learned c/c++/Matlab in the class.
- In doctor hobby: I learned JavaScript on Khan Academy and really enjoyed. I also created a simplified model of self-propelled droplets (my doctor topic). https://fr.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-curling-crawling-circling-creatures/4755055945777152
- In doctor:
  - I used openCV in python to keep track of moving droplets in hundres of images automatically, conducted data analysis with Numpy and visualized results with Matplotlib.
  - I programmed several learning apps with python for my students to practice. I also programmed my favorite board game five-in-a-row with an AI opponent with the algorithm MiniMax.
- As a IT consultant
  - Test
